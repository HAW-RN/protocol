# Agenda

- Showcase of the MVP of each team

# Recap

## Routing protocol

- Showcase of routing protocol MVP
- Do we need to specify the port
  - Answer: Yes, makes sense to specify the port
- Move packet type to common header


## Routed protocol

- Showcase of routed protocol MVP
  - Max size, example, etc.
- Move checksum to common header

## Coding

- We use JSON
- What to do next [See org issues]
- Have a basic common header ala:
```json
{
    "type": "TYPE",
    "version": 1,
    "checksum": "HASH",
    "payload": {
        "ACTUAL_DATA": "ACTUAL_DATA",
        "MORE_DATA": "MORE_DATA",
        "EVEN_MORE_DATA": "EVEN_MORE_DATA",
    }
}
```

## Use Case

- Showcase of use cases
- Consider implementing a client-side "exit" packet
    - Makes sense, only works on graceful shutdown
    - Can be used to signal the end of a connection
        - Otherwise, the connection would be closed by the server


## Organizational issues

- Use Cases and Coding are both at the end of what they have to do [Maybe consolidate teams?]
- Routed protocol also close to done
- Showcase our work on monday
- Ask Becke for how he would imagine tests for our project
